# fnDebrid
> A real-debrid desktop app.

I created this app primarily to have something associated with `.torrent` files & `magnet:` links that would automatically add the download to [real-debrid.com](https://real-debrid.com/torrents) without me having to visit their website, and subsequently automatically downloading the file once it is ready.

While I'm at it, I am additionally creating a section to manage downloads (i.e. delete from [real-debrid.com](https://real-debrid.com/torrents), restart stale downloads, etc.).

I may or may not add support for converting non-torrent links.

## Getting Started
TBD
